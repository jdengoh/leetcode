# Intuition
We have 3 cases to consider here:
* divisble by 5 and 3
* divisible by 5 only
* divisible 3 only

The key learning point in this question is to consider the most "*troublesome*" case first!

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Anything divisible by 5 and 3 must be divisible by 15. Once checked, we will confirm that the element for this number is `FizzBuzz`.

Otherwise, we will check the rest of the cases.
